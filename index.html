              Las Vegas: The Strip, the Mob and the Age of Glamour
            </h3>
            <p class="information">
              In 1941 the El Rancho Vegas resort opened on a section of U.S. 91
              just outside the city’s jurisdiction. Other hotel-casinos soon
              followed, and the section of highway became known as “the Strip.”
              Most were built around the regional or Old West themes that were
              popular on Fremont Street. In 1946 mobster Bugsy Siegel, backed by
              East Coast Jewish gangster Meyer Lansky’s Mexican drug money,
              opened the Flamingo, a swank resort that took its cues from
              Hollywood, not Deadwood. Top-drawer talent was booked for its
              lounges and dozens of celebrities attended its Christmas Day
              opening. Siegel was murdered in 1947, but his vision for Las Vegas
              lived on: During the 1950s and 1960s, mobsters helped build the
              Sahara, the Sands, the New Frontier and the Riviera. Money from
              organized crime combined with funds from more respectable
              investors—Wall Street banks, union pension funds, the Mormon
              Church and the Princeton University endowment. Tourists flocked to
              the resorts—8 million a year by 1954—drawn by performers such as
              Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Elvis Presley, and by rows of slot
              machines and gaming tables. From the 1940s onward Las Vegas
              enjoyed a military boom as World War II bases gave way to Cold War
              facilities, most famously the Nevada Test Site, where over 100
              nuclear bombs were detonated above ground between 1951 and 1963.
              Mushroom clouds were often visible from the hotels on the Strip,
              and postcards proclaimed Las Vegas the “Up and Atom City.”

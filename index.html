            Las Vegas: The Strip, the Mob and the Age of Glamour
          </p>
          <p class="information" id="info">
            In 1941 the El Rancho Vegas resort opened on a section of U.S. 91
            just outside the city’s jurisdiction. Other hotel-casinos soon
            followed, and the section of highway became known as “the Strip.”
            Most were built around the regional or Old West themes that were
            popular on Fremont Street. In 1946 mobster Bugsy Siegel, backed by
            East Coast Jewish gangster Meyer Lansky’s Mexican drug money, opened
            the Flamingo, a swank resort that took its cues from Hollywood, not
            Deadwood. Top-drawer talent was booked for its lounges and dozens of
            celebrities attended its Christmas Day opening. Siegel was murdered
            in 1947, but his vision for Las Vegas lived on: During the 1950s and
            1960s, mobsters helped build the Sahara, the Sands, the New Frontier
            and the Riviera. Money from organized crime combined with funds from
            more respectable investors—Wall Street banks, union pension funds,
            the Mormon Church and the Princeton University endowment. Tourists
            flocked to the resorts—8 million a year by 1954—drawn by performers
            such as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Elvis Presley, and by rows of
            slot machines and gaming tables. From the 1940s onward Las Vegas
            enjoyed a military boom as World War II bases gave way to Cold War
            facilities, most famously the Nevada Test Site, where over 100
            nuclear bombs were detonated above ground between 1951 and 1963.
            Mushroom clouds were often visible from the hotels on the Strip, and
            postcards proclaimed Las Vegas the “Up and Atom City.”
